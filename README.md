Converting a text file to audio reads text aloud to the user. It helps to support struggling students with writing-based knowledge. It helps to proofread, read accurately, understand and write notes. Let’s start developing this very popular python project to convert pdf file to audio speech.

## What is auto Audiobook?
PDF to audio converter means it converts the text into speech.

In this project, I have created the function which converts PDF text files into audio. We can choose any text file from our directory and we can convert it into audio. We can select the voice of our choice and play speed to our convenience. Furthermore, we can download the audiobook to listen on the go.
In this project, we have created a GUI-based converter that converts text into audio using streamlit, speech recognition and pdf libraries. Users can choose any pdf/book that he/she wants. After selecting a particular pdf user clicks on the get audio button so the user is able to hear all the content in the pdf, that’s how we can convert text into audio.
We also let the user preview the pdf while its been read so as to not miss a word. For the users convenince we have added the option to download the audiobook to their device and listen offline as well.
